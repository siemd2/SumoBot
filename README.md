## ðŸš€ Getting Started

To start building your SumoBot, follow these steps:

1. Fork this repository to your own GitHub account or download it as a ZIP file.
2. Gather the required hardware components as listed in the [Hardware Requirements](#hardware-requirements) section.
3. Set up your software environment by following the [Software Setup](#software-setup) instructions.
4. Browse the [Tutorials and Examples](#tutorials-and-examples) section to learn how to assemble and program your SumoBot.

## ðŸ”© Hardware Requirements

To build your SumoBot, you'll need the following components:

- Arduino Uno or compatible microcontroller
- Motor driver shield or module
- DC motors with wheels
- Ultrasonic sensors and/or infrared sensors
- Jumper wires and breadboard
- Chassis for mounting components
- Power supply (battery or USB)


## ðŸ’» Software Setup

To set up your software environment, follow these steps:

1. Install the Arduino IDE: Download and install the [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software) for your operating system.
2. Clone this repository: Clone this repository to your local machine, or download it as a ZIP file and extract it.
3. Install required libraries: Open the Arduino IDE, and install the necessary libraries mentioned in the `dependencies.md` file.
4. Load an example sketch: Open one of the example sketches provided in the `/Examples` directory, and upload it to your Arduino board to test your setup.


## ðŸ“– Tutorials and Examples

Here is a series of tutorials and example projects to help you get started with your SumoBot:

1. [Assembling Your SumoBot](./docs/Tutorials/Assembling-Your-SumoBot.md)
2. [Basic Motor Control](./docs/Tutorials/Basic-Motor-Control.md)
3. [Working with Sensors](./docs/Tutorials/Working-with-Sensors.md)
4. [Creating Simple Behaviors](./docs/Tutorials/Creating-Simple-Behaviors.md)
5. [Advanced Techniques and Strategies](./docs/Tutorials/Advanced-Techniques-and-Strategies.md)

These tutorials and examples will guide you through the process of assembling your SumoBot, programming its movement,implementing decision-making logic to compete in sumo battles. As you progress, you'll learn more advanced techniques and strategies for improving your SumoBot's performance.
